# Space Invaders Game

A python project to build the Space Invaders game from scratch using the pygame module.

This tutorial helped me to learn about the pygame module: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWpgLFMI7w

I added a little more things to the game made in yt video like a restart button and increasing the level of the game when a certain score is reached.

You can clone this repository and run this game on your local. <br>
The only thing you need to install is pygame which you can do by running the below command.

- `pip install pygame`

<hr>

And the game looks like this:
